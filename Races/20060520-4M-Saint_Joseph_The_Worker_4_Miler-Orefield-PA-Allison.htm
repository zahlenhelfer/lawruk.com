Great race overall!  Fairly challenging up and back course with beautiful houses, scenic views, and little traffic. The priest gave a nice little blessing before the race and reminded us the fortune of running. There were a decent number of spectators along the way. The last 1/4 mile is uphill with the finish in view.  The prizes and food afterward were ridiculusly plentiful!  For the $16 race day price, this was an A+ race.
