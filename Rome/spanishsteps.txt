The French church Trinita dei Monti is at the top of the steps.  Interestingly, the steps were designed by an Italian, and paid for by the French who wanted them as a spectacular preface to their church.  The Spanish Steps were so named for the Spanish embassy that was nearby during the construction that lasted from 1723 to 1725.
